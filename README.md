# 👋I'm Haejin Park!

I am an **Embedded Software Engineer** bridging the gap between embedded hardware control and autonomous driving algorithms.

## 🛠️ Engineering Project: Autonomous RC Car Platform
> *Building a full-stack self-driving platform from scratch with Raspberry Pi 5.*

* **System Integration:**
    * Designed a **Dual-Power Architecture** using a dedicated HAT and separated battery sources for system stability.
    * Implemented **Encoder-based Odometry** via GPIO Interrupts for precise motion estimation.
    * Solved real-time hardware constraints using **C++ based Motor Control**.
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5, IMX708 Wide-Angle Camera, Ackermann Steering Chassis.
* **Software:** C++, Python (Flask/WebSocket), WiringPi/Pigpio.

## 🔬 Research Focus: 3D Perception
> *Studying advanced perception algorithms for future mobility.*

* **PointPillars Implementation:**
    * Implementing and analyzing the PointPillars architecture for 3D object detection.
    * Working with LiDAR point cloud datasets (e.g., KITTI) to understand sparse data processing.
    * (여기에 추후 성과가 나오면 추가: Optimizing inference speed with C++ / TensorRT etc.)

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Languages:** C++ (Main), Python
* **Embedded:** Linux System Programming, GPIO/PWM/I2C Control
* **Tools:** ROS2, Docker, Git

## 🎓 Education
* **Kyungpook National University (KNU)**
